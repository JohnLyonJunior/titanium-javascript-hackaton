Titanium Hackathon Starter
=======================

![](https://github.com/PovarovDenis/titanium-javascript-hackaton/blob/master/main.PNG)

A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications based on https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter

If you have attended any hackathons in the past, then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started: decide on what to build, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you might have an initial project up on GitHub and only then
can other team members start contributing. Or how about doing something as simple as *Sign in with Facebook*
authentication? You can spend hours on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works.

**Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch ask your Mentor

Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Get the latest snapshot
git clone https://github.com/PovarovDenis/titanium-javascript-hackaton

# Change directory
cd myproject

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

# Then simply start your app
node app.js
```

**Note:** I highly recommend installing [Nodemon](https://github.com/remy/nodemon).
It watches for any changes in your  node.js app and automatically restarts the
server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`. It will
save you a lot of time in the long run, because you won't need to manually
restart the server each time you make a small change in code. To install, run
`sudo npm install -g nodemon`.

TODO
---------------

### 1. Fork Titanium boilerplate

  To start work with the team on the Titanium Hackaton first of all you need to fork the repository.

  Tasks:
  - [ ] One of the team members forks repository to his Github account
  - [ ] That repository owner grants accesses to all team members
  - [ ] All of the team members has cloned project on their laptops

  Readings:
  - [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)
  - [Inviting collaborators to a personal repository](https://help.github.com/articles/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)

### 2. Install Titanium boilerplate and check if tests pass

  Now you can install all needed dependencies and a Database to run the application.
  Successful criteria on this step is: you have working app on `localhost:8080` and you DB is ready to store all your data.

  Tasks:
  - [ ] Install all npm packages
  - [ ] Install and run Mongo DB
  - [ ] Run the application (`npm run start`)
  - [ ] Check if the tests pass (`npm run test`)
  - [ ] Check if the tests pass (`npm run test`)
  - [ ] Get familiar with the application, in general

  Readings:
  - [Install Node.js with npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
  - [Install Mongo DB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)
  - [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) test framework
  - [Chai](http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/) assertion library
  - [Node `process`](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html)
  - [Express](http://expressjs.com/ru/) web framework

### 3. Create admin page and page for adding new Lessons

  In this step you will implement two pages: one simple page *Adminpanel* and page for adding new Lessons.
  First of all you need to add page `/admin` where will be just 1 button: *Add new Lesson*.
  On clicking the button user will go to the Lesson form. To add this page you need to add also API endpoint
  on server (basic endpoint just to serve the template you'll prepare in `/views/admin/admin.pug`)
  Lesson form represents page with 2 inputs: one for *Lesson name* and one for *Lesson description*.
  On *API* you need to implement API endpoint (request handler) and save new lesson to the DB for the Lesson form.

  Tips:
    - add routes to `app.js`
    - then add templates to `/views/`
    - create new controller `/controllers/lesson.js` for request handlers
    - add new Collection to the Database and call it `lessons`

  Tasks:
  - [ ] Create template using PUG for a new page `/admin/lesson-form`
    - Input `type="text"` for Lesson name
    - Input `textarea` for Lesson description
  - [ ] Implement API endpoint for new page `/admin/lesson-form`
    - `GET` to serve the template
    - `POST` to save a new Lesson to the Database

  Readings:
  - [Project Structure](https://github.com/PovarovDenis/titanium-javascript-hackaton#project-structure)
  - [How do I create a new page?](https://github.com/PovarovDenis/titanium-javascript-hackaton#how-do-i-create-a-new-page)
  - [PUG](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html) HTML preprocessor
  - [Add new collection to Mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/method/db.createCollection/)
  - [Insert new document to Mongo](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/insert-documents/)

  Extra:
  - [ ] Add functionality to edit lessons (`/admin/lesson-form/edit/:LessonId`)
    - In this step you also need to add functionality to list all lessons in adminpanel (`/admin`) under button *Add new Lesson*
  - [ ] Write unit tests for the API endpoints

### 4. Create page for adding new Tasks

  This step is very similar to the previous one.

  Tasks:
  - [ ] Edit the config and specify the `migrations` field in the knex initialization `Object`, for example:
    ```js
      {
        client: 'pg',
        connection: '...',
        migrations: {
          directory: path.join(__dirname, './migrations')
        }
      }
    ```
  - [ ] Create one migration file per table (eg. `1-create-user.js`, `2-create-repository.js`, `3-create-contribution.js`) with the following skeleton:
    - `up` method has the logic for the migration, `down` is for reverting it
    - The migrations are executed in transactions
    - The files are executed in alphabetical order
    ```js
    'use strict'

    const tableName = '...'

    function up(knex) {
      return knex.schema.createTable(tableName, (table) => {
        // your code goes here
      })
    }

    function down(knex) {
      return knex.schema.dropTableIfExists(tableName)
    }

    module.exports = {
      up,
      down
    }
    ```
  - [ ] Add a `migrate-db` script to the scripts in `package.json`, edit `scripts/migrate-db.js` to add the migration call. Finally, run your migration script to create the tables:
    ```sh
    $ npm run migrate-db -- --local
    ```

  - [`knex` migrations API](http://knexjs.org/#Migrations-API)
  - [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts)

### 5. Create page to list all Lessons

  In this step you will implement another process of the application, the worker. We will trigger a request to collect the contributions for repositories based on some query. The trigger will send messages to another channel, the handler for this channel is reponsible to fetch the repositories. The third channel is used to fetch and save the contributions.

  **Make a drawing of the message flow, it will help you a lot!**

  Tasks:
  - [ ] Start Redis locally
  - [ ] Implement the contributions handler:
    - The responsibility of the contributions handler is to fetch the contributions of a repository from the GitHub API and to save the contributors and their line counts to the database
    - Validate the `message`, it has two fields: `date` and `repository` with `id` and `full_name` fields
    - Get the contributions from the GitHub API (use your models created in step 2)
    - Count all the lines currently in the repository per users (use `lodash` and `Array` functions)
    - Save the users to the database, don't fail if the user already exists (use your models created in step 3)
    - Save the contributions to the database, insert or replace (use your models created in step 3)
  - [ ] Implement the repository handler:
    - Validate the `message`, it has three fields: `date`, `query` and `page`
    - Get the repositories from the GitHub API (use your models created in step 2) with the `q`, `page` and `per_page` (set to 100) query parameters.
    - Modify the response to a format which is close to the database models (try to use [`lodash/fp`](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide))
    - Save the owner to the database, don't fail if the user already exists (use your models created in step 3)
    - Save the repository to the database, don't fail if the repository already exists (use your models created in step 3)
    - Publish a message to the `contributions` channel with the same `date`
  - [ ] Implement the trigger handler:
    - The responsibility of the trigger handler is to send 10 messages to the `repository` collect channel implemented above. 10, because GitHub only gives access to the first 1000 (10 * page size of 100) search results
    - Validate the `message`, it has two fields: `date` and `query`
  - [ ] We would like to make our first search and data collection from GitHub.
    - For this, create a trigger.js file in the scripts folder. It should be a simple run once Node script which will publish a message to the `trigger` channel with the query passed in as an environment variable (`TRIGGER_QUERY`), then exit. It should have the same `--local`, `-L` flag, but for setting the `REDIS_URI`, as the migrate-db script.
    - Add a `trigger` field to the scripts in `package.json` that calls your `trigger.js` script.

  - [`ioredis`](https://github.com/luin/ioredis)

### 6. Create page for detail view of each Lesson

  In this step you will add a few routes to the existing web application to trigger a data crawl and to expose the collected data.

  Tasks:
  - [ ] The database requirements changed in the meantime, create a new migration (call it `4-add-indexes.js`), add indexes to `user.login` and `repository.full_name` (use `knex.schema.alterTable`)
  - [ ] Implement the `POST /api/v1/trigger` route, the body contains an object with a string `query` field, you will use this query to send a message to the corresponding Redis channel. Return `201` when it was successful
  - [ ] Implement the `GET /api/v1/repository/:id` and `GET /api/v1/repository/:owner/:name` endpoints
  - [ ] Implement the `GET /api/v1/repository/:id/contributions`  and `GET /api/v1/repository/:owner/:name/contributions` endpoints
  - [ ] Create a middleware (`requestLogger({ level = 'silly' })`) and add it to your server, that logs out:
    - The method and original url of the request
    - Request headers (except `authorization` and `cookie`) and body
    - The request duration in `ms`
    - Response headers (except `authorization` and `cookie`) and body
    - Response status code (based on it: log level should be `error` when server error, `warn` when client error)
  - [ ] Document your API using [Apiary](https://apiary.io/)'s Blueprint format (edit the `API_DOCUMENTATION.apib`).

  Notes:
  - Make use of [koa-compose](https://github.com/koajs/compose) and the validator middleware
    ```js
    compose([
      middleware.validator({
        params: paramsSchema,
        query: querySchema,
        body: bodySchema
      }),
      // additional middleware
    ])
    ```

  - [API Blueprint tutorial](https://help.apiary.io/api_101/api_blueprint_tutorial/)

### 7. Create page for detail view of each Task

  In this step you will add some features, which are required to have your application running in production environment.

  Tasks:
  - [ ] Listen on the `SIGTERM` signal in `web/index.js`.
    - Create a function called `gracefulShutdown`
    - Use koa's `.callback()` function to create a `http` server (look for `http.createServer`) and convert `server.close` with `util.promisify`
    - Close the server and destroy the database and redis connections (use the `destroy` function to the redis model, which calls `disconnect` on both redis clients and returns a `Promise`)
    - Log out and exit the process with code `1` if something fails
    - Exit the process with code `0` if everything is closed succesfully
  - [ ] Implement the same for the worker process
  - [ ] Add a health check endpoint for the web server
    - Add a `healthCheck` function for the database model, use the `PG_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT` environment variable to set the query timeout (set default to `2000` ms)
    - Add a `healthCheck` function to the redis model
    - Implement the `GET /healthz` endpoint, return `200` with JSON body `{ "status": "ok" }`when everything is healthy, `500` if any of the database or redis connections are not healthy and `503` if the process got `SIGTERM` signal
  - [ ] Create a http server and add a similar health check endpoint for the worker process

  - [Signal events](https://nodejs.org/api/process.html#process_signal_events)
  - [Graceful shutdown](https://blog.risingstack.com/graceful-shutdown-node-js-kubernetes/)
  - [Health checks](http://microservices.io/patterns/observability/health-check-api.html)

### 8. Update main page to represent your Idea

  In this step you will implement and test helper functions for inserting, changing and reading data from the database.

  Tasks:
  - [ ] Implement the user model:
    - `User.insert({ id, login, avatar_url, html_url, type })`
      - validate the parameters
    - `User.read({ id, login })`
      - validate the parameters
      - one is required: `id` or `login`
  - [ ] Implement the repository model:
    - `Repository.insert({ id, owner, full_name, description, html_url, language, stargazers_count })`
      - Validate the parameters
      - `description` and `language` can be empty `String`s
    - `Repository.read({ id, full_name })`
      - Validate the parameters
      - One is required: `id` or `full_name`
      - Return the owner as well as an object (join tables and reorganize fields)
  - [ ] Implement the contribution model:
    - `Contribution.insert({ repository, user, line_count })`
      - Validate the parameters
    - `Contribution.insertOrReplace({ repository, user, line_count })`
      - Validate the parameters
      - Use a [raw query](http://knexjs.org/#Raw-Queries) and the [`ON CONFLICT`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/sql-insert.html) SQL expression
    - `Contribution.read({ user: { id, login }, repository: { id, full_name } })`
      - Validate the parameters
      - The function parameter should be an Object, it should contain either a user, either a repository field or both of them.

        If only the user is provided, then all the contributions of that user will be resolved.
        If only the repository is provided, than all the users who contributed to that repository will be resolved.
        If both are provided, then it will match the contribution of a particular user to a particular repo.

      - The functions resolves to an Array of contributions (when both a user and a repository identifier is passed, it will only have 1 element)
      - Return the repository and user as well as an object
      (*This requirement is just for the sake of making up a problem, when you actually need this function, you will most likely have the user or the repository Object in a whole*)
        ```js
        {
          line_count: 10,
          user: { id: 1, login: 'coconut', ... },
          repository: { id: 1, full_name: 'risingstack/repo', ... }
        }
        ```
      - Use a **single** SQL query
      - When you join the tables, there will be conflicting column names (`id`, `html_url`). Use the `as` keyword when selecting columns (eg. `repository.id as repository_id`) to avoid this

  Notes:
  - `user` is a reserved keyword in PG, use double quotes where you reference the table in a raw query
  - You can get the columns of a table by querying `information_schema.columns`, which can be useful to select fields dinamically when joining tables, eg.:
    ```sql
    SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='contribution';
    ```


### 9. Prepare your service for production

  In this step you will add some features, which are required to have your application running in production environment.

  Tasks:
  - [ ] Listen on the `SIGTERM` signal in `web/index.js`.
    - Create a function called `gracefulShutdown`
    - Use koa's `.callback()` function to create a `http` server (look for `http.createServer`) and convert `server.close` with `util.promisify`
    - Close the server and destroy the database and redis connections (use the `destroy` function to the redis model, which calls `disconnect` on both redis clients and returns a `Promise`)
    - Log out and exit the process with code `1` if something fails
    - Exit the process with code `0` if everything is closed succesfully
  - [ ] Implement the same for the worker process
  - [ ] Add a health check endpoint for the web server
    - Add a `healthCheck` function for the database model, use the `PG_HEALTH_CHECK_TIMEOUT` environment variable to set the query timeout (set default to `2000` ms)
    - Add a `healthCheck` function to the redis model
    - Implement the `GET /healthz` endpoint, return `200` with JSON body `{ "status": "ok" }`when everything is healthy, `500` if any of the database or redis connections are not healthy and `503` if the process got `SIGTERM` signal
  - [ ] Create a http server and add a similar health check endpoint for the worker process

| package-lock.lock                          | Contains exact versions of NPM dependencies in package.json. |

**Note:** There is no preference how you name or structure your views.
You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without
having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you.
Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding
`res.render()` paths in controllers.

Pro Tips
--------

- When installing an NPM package, add a *--save* flag, and it will be automatically
added to `package.json` as well. For example, `npm install --save moment`.
- Use [async.parallel()](https://github.com/caolan/async#parallel) when you need to run multiple
asynchronous tasks, and then render a page, but only when all tasks are completed. For example, you might
want to scrape 3 different websites for some data and render the results in a template
after all 3 websites have been scraped.
- Need to find a specific object inside an Array? Use [_.find](http://lodash.com/docs#find)
function from Lodash. For example, this is how you would retrieve a
Twitter token from database: `var token = _.find(req.user.tokens, { kind: 'twitter' });`,
where 1st parameter is an array, and a 2nd parameter is an object to search for.

FAQ
---

### Why do I get `403 Error: Forbidden` when submitting a form?
You need to add the following hidden input element to your form. This has been
added in the [pull request #40](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/40)
as part of the CSRF protection.

```
input(type='hidden', name='_csrf', value=_csrf)
```

**Note:** It is now possible to whitelist certain URLs. In other words you can
specify a list of routes that should bypass CSRF verification check.

**Note 2:** To whitelist dynamic URLs use regular expression tests inside the
CSRF middleware to see if `req.originalUrl` matches your desired pattern.

### I am getting MongoDB Connection Error, how do I fix it?
That's a custom error message defined in `app.js` to indicate that there was a
problem connecting to MongoDB:

```js
mongoose.connection.on('error', () => {
  console.error('MongoDB Connection Error. Please make sure MongoDB is running.');
});
```
You need to have a MongoDB server running before launching `app.js`. You can
download MongoDB [here](http://mongodb.org/downloads), or install it via a package manager.
<img src="http://dc942d419843af05523b-ff74ae13537a01be6cfec5927837dcfe.r14.cf1.rackcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/windows-8-50x50.jpg" height="17">
Windows users, read [Install MongoDB on Windows](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/).

**Tip:** If you are always connected to the internet, you could just use
[mLab](https://mongolab.com/) or [Compose](https://www.compose.io/) instead
of downloading and installing MongoDB locally. You will only need to update database credentials
in `.env` file.

### Why Pug (Jade) instead of Handlebars?
When I first started this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find `extends` and `block` to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.

### Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?
For the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach,
such as passing `app` context to each controller as outlined in this
[blog](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/),
I find such style to be confusing for beginners.
It took me a long time to grasp the concept of `exports` and `module.exports`,
let alone having a global `app` reference in other files.
That to me is a backward thinking.
The `app.js` is the "heart of the app", it should be the one referencing
models, routes, controllers, etc.
When working solo on small projects I actually prefer to have everything inside `app.js` as is the case with [this]((https://github.com/sahat/ember-sass-express-starter/blob/master/app.js))
REST API server.


### Why is there no Mozilla Persona as a sign-in option?
If you would like to use **Persona** authentication strategy, use the
[pull request #64](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/pull/64) as a
reference guide. I have explained my reasons why it could not be merged in
[issue #63](https://github.com/sahat/hackathon-starter/issues/63#issuecomment-34898290).

### How do I switch SendGrid for another email delivery service, like Mailgun or SparkPost?
Inside the `nodemailer.createTransport` method arguments, simply change the service from `'Sendgrid'` to some other email service. Also, be sure to update both username and password below that. See the [list of all supported services](https://github.com/nodemailer/nodemailer-wellknown#supported-services) by Nodemailer.

How It Works (mini guides)
--------------------------

This section is intended for giving you a detailed explanation about
how a particular functionality works. Maybe you are just curious about
how it works, or maybe you are lost and confused while reading the code,
I hope it provides some guidance to you.

### Custom HTML and CSS Design 101

[HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/) has many beautiful templates that you can download for free.

When you download the ZIP file, it will come with *index.html*, *images*, *css* and *js* folders. So, how do you
integrate it with Hackathon Starter? Hackathon Starter uses Bootstrap CSS framework, but these templates do not.
Trying to use both CSS files at the same time will likely result in undesired effects.

**Note:** Using the custom templates approach, you should understand that you cannot reuse any of the views I have created: layout, home page, api browser, login, signup, account management, contact. Those views were built using Bootstrap grid and styles. You will have to manually update the grid using a different syntax provided in the template. **Having said that, you can mix and match if you want to do so: Use Bootstrap for main app interface, and a custom template for a landing page.**

Let's start from the beginning. For this example I will use [Escape Velocity](http://html5up.net/escape-velocity/) template:
![Alt](http://html5up.net/uploads/images/escape-velocity.jpg)

**Note:** For the sake of simplicity I will only consider `index.html`, and skip `left-sidebar.html`,
`no-sidebar.html`, `right-sidebar.html`.

Move all JavaScript files from `html5up-escape-velocity/js` to `public/js`. Then move all CSS files from `html5up-escape-velocity/css` to `public/css`. And finally, move all images from `html5up-escape-velocity/images` to `public/images`. You could move it to the existing **img** folder, but that would require manually changing every `img` reference. Grab the contents of `index.html` and paste it into [HTML To Jade](http://html2jade.aaron-powell.com/).

**Note:** Do not forget to update all the CSS and JS paths accordingly.

Create a new file `escape-velocity.pug` and paste the Pug markup in `views` folder.
Whenever you see the code `res.render('account/login')` - that means it will search for `views/account/login.pug` file.

Let's see how it looks. Create a new controller **escapeVelocity** inside `controllers/home.js`:

```js
exports.escapeVelocity = (req, res) => {
  res.render('escape-velocity', {
    title: 'Landing Page'
  });
};
```

And then create a route in `app.js`. I placed it right after the index controller:
```js
app.get('/escape-velocity', homeController.escapeVelocity);
```

Restart the server (if you are not using **nodemon**), then you should see the new template at [http://localhost:3000/escape-velocity](http://localhost:3000/escape-velocity).

I will stop right here, but if you would like to use this template as more than just a single page, take a look at how these Jade templates work: `layout.pug` - base template, `index.pug` - home page, `partials/header.pug` - Bootstrap navbar, `partials/footer.pug` - sticky footer. You will have to manually break it apart into smaller pieces. Figure out which part of the template you want to keep the same on all pages - that's your new `layout.pug`.
Then, each page that changes, be it `index.pug`, `about.pug`, `contact.pug`
will be embedded in your new `layout.pug` via `block content`. Use existing templates as a reference.

This is a rather lengthy process, and templates you get from elsewhere,
might have yet another grid system. That's why I chose *Bootstrap* for the Hackathon Starter.
 Many people are already familiar with *Bootstrap*, plus it's easy to get started with it if you have never used *Bootstrap*.
 You can also buy many beautifully designed *Bootstrap* themes at [Themeforest](http://themeforest.net/), and use them as a drop-in replacement for Hackathon Starter. However, if you would like to go with a completely custom HTML/CSS design, this should help you to get started!

### How do flash messages work in this project?
Flash messages allow you to display a message at the end of the request and access
it on next request and only next request. For instance, on a failed login attempt, you would
display an alert with some error message, but as soon as you refresh that page or visit a different
page and come back to the login page, that error message will be gone. It is only displayed once.
This project uses *express-flash* module for flash messages. And that
module is built on top of *connect-flash*, which is what I used in
this project initially. With *express-flash* you don't have to
explicitly send a flash message to every view inside `res.render()`.
All flash messages are available in your views via `messages` object by default,
thanks to *express-flash*.

Flash messages have a two-step process. You use `req.flash('errors', { msg: 'Error messages goes here' }`
to create a flash message in your controllers, and then display them in your views:
```jade
if messages.errors
  .alert.alert-danger.fade.in
    for error in messages.errors
      div= error.msg
```
In the first step, `'errors'` is the name of a flash message, which should match the
name of the property on `messages` object in your views. You place alert messages
inside `if message.errors` because you don't want to show them flash messages are actually present.
The reason why you pass an error like `{ msg: 'Error messages goes here' }` instead
of just a string - `'Error messages goes here'`, is for the sake of consistency.
To clarify that, *express-validator* module which is used for validating and sanitizing user's input,
returns all errors as an array of objects, where each object has a `msg` property with a message
why an error has occurred. Here is a more general example of what express-validator returns when there are errors present:

```js
[
  { param: "name", msg: "Name is required", value: "<received input>" },
  { param: "email", msg: "A valid email is required", value: "<received input>" }
]
```

To keep consistent with that style, you should pass all flash messages
as `{ msg: 'My flash message' }` instead of a string. Otherwise you will just see an alert box
without an error message. That is because, in **partials/flash.pug** template it will try to output
`error.msg` (i.e. `"My flash message".msg`), in other words it will try to call a `msg` method on a *String* object,
which will return *undefined*. Everything I just mentioned about errors, also applies
to "info" and "success" flash messages, and you could even create a new one yourself, such as:

**Data Usage Controller (Example)**
```
req.flash('warning', { msg: 'You have exceeded 90% of your data usage' });
```

**User Account Page (Example)**
```jade
if messages.warning
  .alert.alert-warning.fade.in
    for warning in messages.warning
      div= warning.msg
```

`partials/flash.pug` is a partial template that contains how flash messages
are formatted. Previously, flash
messages were scattered throughout each view that used flash messages
(contact, login, signup, profile), but now, thankfully it is uses a *DRY* approach.

The flash messages partial template is *included* in the `layout.pug`, along with footer and navigation.
```jade
body
    include partials/header

    .container
      include partials/flash
      block content

    include partials/footer
```

If you have any further questions about flash messages,
please feel free to open an issue and I will update this mini-guide accordingly,
or send a pull request if you  would like to include something that I missed.

A more correct way to be to say "How do I create a new route". The main file `app.js` contains all the routes.
Each route has a callback function associated with it. Sometimes you will see 3 or more arguments
to routes. In cases like that, the first argument is still a URL string, while middle arguments
are what's called middleware. Think of middleware as a door. If this door prevents you from
continuing forward, you won't get to your callback function. One such example is a route that requires authentication.

```js
app.get('/account', passportConfig.isAuthenticated, userController.getAccount);
```

It always goes from left to right. A user visits `/account` page. Then `isAuthenticated` middleware
checks if you are authenticated:

```js
exports.isAuthenticated = (req, res, next) => {
  if (req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return next();
  }
  res.redirect('/login');
};
```

If you are authenticated, you let this visitor pass through your "door" by calling `return next();`. It then proceeds to the
next middleware until it reaches the last argument, which is a callback function that typically renders a template on `GET` requests or redirects on `POST` requests. In this case, if you are authenticated, you will be redirected to *Account Management* page, otherwise you will be redirected to *Login* page.

```js
exports.getAccount = (req, res) => {
  res.render('account/profile', {
    title: 'Account Management'
  });
};
```

Express.js has `app.get`, `app.post`, `app.put`, `app.delete`, but for the most part you will only use the first two HTTP verbs, unless you are building a RESTful API.
If you just want to display a page, then use `GET`, if you are submitting a form, sending a file then use `POST`.

Here is a typical workflow for adding new routes to your application. Let's say we are building
a page that lists all books from database.

**Step 1.** Start by defining a route.
```js
app.get('/books', bookController.getBooks);
```

---

**Note:** As of Express 4.x you can define you routes like so:

```js
app.route('/books')
  .get(bookController.getBooks)
  .post(bookController.createBooks)
  .put(bookController.updateBooks)
  .delete(bookController.deleteBooks)
```

And here is how a route would look if it required an *authentication* and an *authorization* middleware:

```js
app.route('/api/twitter')
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthenticated)
  .all(passportConfig.isAuthorized)
  .get(apiController.getTwitter)
  .post(apiController.postTwitter)
```

Use whichever style that makes sense to you. Either one is acceptable. I really think that chaining HTTP verbs on
`app.route` is very clean and elegant approach, but on the other hand I can no longer see all my routes at a glance
when you have one route per line.

**Step 2.** Create a new schema and a model `Book.js` inside the *models* directory.
```js
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

const bookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String
});

const Book = mongoose.model('Book', bookSchema);
module.exports = Book;
```

**Step 3.** Create a new controller file called `book.js` inside the *controllers* directory.
```js
/**
 * GET /books
 * List all books.
 */
const Book = require('../models/Book.js');

exports.getBooks = (req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
};
```

**Step 4.** Import that controller in `app.js`.
```js
const bookController = require('./controllers/book');
```

**Step 5.** Create `books.pug` template.
```jade
extends layout

block content
  .page-header
    h3 All Books

  ul
    for book in books
      li= book.name
```

That's it! I will say that you could have combined Step 1, 2, 3 as following:

```js
app.get('/books',(req, res) => {
  Book.find((err, docs) => {
    res.render('books', { books: docs });
  });
});
```

Sure, it's simpler, but as soon as you pass 1000 lines of code in `app.js` it becomes a little difficult to navigate the file.
I mean, the whole point of this boilerplate project was to separate concerns, so you could
work with your teammates without running into *MERGE CONFLICTS*. Imagine you have 4 developers
working on a single `app.js`, I promise you it won't be fun resolving merge conflicts all the time.
If you are the only developer then it's fine. But as I said, once it gets up to a certain LoC size, it becomes
difficult to maintain everything in a single file.

That's all there is to it. Express.js is super simple to use.
Most of the time you will be dealing with other APIs to do the real work:
[Mongoose](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html) for querying database, socket.io for sending and receiving messages over websockets,
sending emails via [Nodemailer](http://nodemailer.com/), form validation using [express-validator](https://github.com/ctavan/express-validator) library,
parsing websites using [Cheerio](https://github.com/cheeriojs/cheerio), and etc.

### How do I use Socket.io with Hackathon Starter?
[Dan Stroot](https://github.com/dstroot) submitted an excellent [pull request](https://github.com/dstroot/hackathon-starter/commit/0a632def1ce8da446709d92812423d337c977d75) that adds a real-time dashboard with socket.io.
And as  much as I'd like to add it to the project, I think it violates one of the main
principles of the Hackathon Starter:
> When I started this project, my primary focus was on simplicity and ease of use.
> I also tried to make it as generic and reusable as possible to cover most use cases of
> hackathon web apps, **without being too specific**.

When I need to use socket.io, I **really** need it, but most of the time - I don't. But more
importantly, websockets support is still experimental on most hosting providers. As of October 2013,
Heroku supports websockets, but not until you opt-in by running this command:

```js
heroku labs:enable websockets -a myapp
```

And what if you are deploying to OpenShift? They do support websockets, but it is currently in a
preview state. So, for OpenShift you would need to change the socket.io connect URI to the following:

```js
const socket = io.connect('http://yoursite-namespace.rhcloud.com:8000');
```

Wait, why is it on port 8000? Who knows, and if I didn't run across this [blog post](http://velin-georgiev-blog.appspot.com/blog/set-up-nodejs-express-socketio-application-using-websockets-on-openshift-by-red-hat/)
I wouldn't even know I had to use port 8000.

I am really glad that Heroku and OpenShift at least
have a websockets support, because many other PaaS providers still do not support it.
Due to the aforementioned issues with websockets, I cannot include socket.io as part of the Hackathon Starter. *For now...*
If you need to use socket.io in your app, please continue reading.

First you need to install socket.io:
```js
npm install socket.io --save
```

Replace `const app = express();` with the following code:

```js
const app = express();
const server = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(server);
```

I like to have the following code organization in `app.js` (from top to bottom): module dependencies,
import controllers, import configs, connect to database, express configuration, routes,
start the server, socket.io stuff. That way I always know where to look for things.

Add the following code at the end of `app.js`:

```js
io.on('connection', (socket) => {
  socket.emit('greet', { hello: 'Hey there browser!' });
  socket.on('respond', (data) => {
    console.log(data);
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', () => {
    console.log('Socket disconnected');
  });
});
```

One last thing left to change:
```js
app.listen(app.get('port'), () => {
```
to
```js
server.listen(app.get('port'), () => {
```

At this point we are done with the back-end.

You now have a choice - to include your JavaScript code in Pug templates or have all your client-side
JavaScript in a separate file - in `main.js`. I will admit, when I first started out with Node.js and JavaScript in general,
I placed all JavaScript code inside templates because I have access to template variables passed in from Express
right then and there. It's the easiest thing you can do, but also the least efficient and harder to maintain. Since then I
almost never include inline JavaScript inside templates anymore.

But it's also understandable if you want take the easier road.
Most of the time you don't even care about performance during hackathons, you just
want to [*"get shit done"*](https://www.startupvitamins.com/media/products/13/aaron_levie_poster_black.jpg) before the time runs out.
Well, either way, use whichever approach makes more sense to you. At the end of the day,
it's **what** you build that matters, not **how** you build it.

If you want to stick all your JavaScript inside templates, then in `layout.pug` -
your main template file, add this to `head` block.

```jade
script(src='/socket.io/socket.io.js')
script.
    let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
    socket.on('greet', function (data) {
      console.log(data);
      socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hey there, server!' });
    });
```

**Note:** Notice the path of the `socket.io.js`, you don't actually
have to have `socket.io.js` file anywhere in your project; it will be generated
automatically at runtime.

If you want to have JavaScript code separate from templates, move that inline
script code into `main.js`, inside the `$(document).ready()` function:

```js
$(document).ready(function() {

  // Place JavaScript code here...
  let socket = io.connect(window.location.href);
  socket.on('greet', function (data) {
    console.log(data);
    socket.emit('respond', { message: 'Hello to you too, Mr.Server!' });
  });

});
```

And we are done!
Cheatsheets
-----------

### <img src="https://frontendmasters.com/assets/es6-logo.png" height="34" align="top"> ES6 Cheatsheet

#### Declarations

Declares a read-only named constant.

```js
const name = 'yourName';
```

Declares a block scope local variable.
```js
let index = 0;
```

#### Template Strings

Using the **\`${}\`** syntax, strings can embed expressions.

```js
const name = 'Oggy';
const age = 3;

console.log(`My cat is named ${name} and is ${age} years old.`);
```

#### Modules

To import functions, objects or primitives exported from an external module. These are the most common types of importing.

```js
import name from 'module-name';
```
```js
import * as name from 'module-name';
```
```js
import { foo, bar } from 'module-name';
```

To export functions, objects or primitives from a given file or module.

```js
export { myFunction };
```
```js
export const name = 'yourName';
```
```js
export default myFunctionOrClass
```

#### Spread Operator

The spread operator allows an expression to be expanded in places where multiple arguments (for function calls) or multiple elements (for array literals) are expected.

```js
myFunction(...iterableObject);
```
```jsx
<ChildComponent {...this.props} />
```

#### Promises

A Promise is used in asynchronous computations to represent an operation that hasn't completed yet, but is expected in the future.

```js
var p = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) { });
```

The `catch()` method returns a Promise and deals with rejected cases only.

```js
p.catch(function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
```

The `then()` method returns a Promise. It takes 2 arguments: callback for the success & failure cases.

```js
p.then(function(value) { /* handle fulfillment */ }, function(reason) { /* handle rejection */ });
```

The `Promise.all(iterable)` method returns a promise that resolves when all of the promises in the iterable argument have resolved, or rejects with the reason of the first passed promise that rejects.

```js
Promise.all([p1, p2, p3]).then(function(values) { console.log(values) });
```

#### Arrow Functions

Arrow function expression. Shorter syntax & lexically binds the `this` value. Arrow functions are anonymous.

```js
singleParam => { statements }
```
```js
() => { statements }
```
```js
(param1, param2) => expression
```
```js
const arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const squares = arr.map(x => x * x);
```

#### Classes

The class declaration creates a new class using prototype-based inheritance.

```js
class Person {
  constructor(name, age, gender) {
    this.name   = name;
    this.age    = age;
    this.gender = gender;
  }

  incrementAge() {
    this.age++;
  }
}
```

#### Unix Timestamp (seconds)

```js
Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000);
```

#### Add 30 minutes to a Date object

```js

now.setMinutes(now.getMinutes() + 30);
```

#### Date Formatting

```js
// DD-MM-YYYY
var now = new Date();

var DD = now.getDate();
var MM = now.getMonth() + 1;
var YYYY = now.getFullYear();

if (DD < 10) {
  DD = '0' + DD;
} 

if (MM < 10) {
  MM = '0' + MM;
}

console.log(MM + '-' + DD + '-' + YYYY); // 03-30-2016
```
```js
// hh:mm (12 hour time with am/pm)
var now = new Date();
var hours = now.getHours();
var minutes = now.getMinutes();
var amPm = hours >= 12 ? 'pm' : 'am';

hours = hours % 12;
hours = hours ? hours : 12;
minutes = minutes < 10 ? '0' + minutes : minutes;

console.log(hours + ':' + minutes + ' ' + amPm); // 1:43 am

### Mongoose Cheatsheet

#### Find all users:
```js
User.find((err, users) => {
  console.log(users);
});
```

#### Find a user by email:
```js
let userEmail = 'example@gmail.com';
User.findOne({ email: userEmail }, (err, user) => {
  console.log(user);
});
```

#### Find 5 most recent user accounts:
```js
User
  .find()
  .sort({ _id: -1 })
  .limit(5)
  .exec((err, users) => {
    console.log(users);
  });
```

#### Get total count of a field from all documents:
Let's suppose that each user has a `votes` field and you would like to count
the total number of votes in your database across all users. One very
inefficient way would be to loop through each document and manually accumulate
the count. Or you could use [MongoDB Aggregation Framework](https://docs.mongodb.org/manual/core/aggregation-introduction/) instead:

```js
User.aggregate({ $group: { _id: null, total: { $sum: '$votes' } } }, (err, votesCount)  => {
  console.log(votesCount.total);
});
```
:top: <sub>[**back to top**](#table-of-contents)</sub>

Docker
----------

You will need docker and docker-compose installed to build the application. 

- [Docker installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

- [Common problems setting up docker](https://docs.docker.com/toolbox/faqs/troubleshoot/)

After installing docker, start the application with the following commands : 

```
# To build the project for the first time or when you add dependencies
docker-compose build web  

# To start the application (or to restart after making changes to the source code)
docker-compose up web

```

To view the app, find your docker ip address + port 3000 ( this will typically be http://192.168.99.100:3000/ ).


Obtaining API Keys
------------------

To use any of the included APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need
to obtain appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or
Username & Password. You will need to go through each provider to generate new
credentials.

**Hackathon Starter 2.0 Update:** I have included dummy keys and passwords for
all API examples to get you up and running even faster. But don't forget to update
them with *your credentials* when you are ready to deploy an app.
